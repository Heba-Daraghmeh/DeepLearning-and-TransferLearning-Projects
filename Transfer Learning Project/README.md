# Stance Detection with CAMelBERT (Transfer Learning)

## 📖 Overview
This project applies **Transfer Learning** in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by fine-tuning a pre-trained **CAMelBERT** model to perform **stance detection**.  
The model determines the stance (e.g., agree, disagree, neutral) of a given text toward a particular target.

## 🎯 Objective
- Fine-tune CAMelBERT on a stance detection dataset.  
- Leverage pre-trained embeddings to improve classification accuracy with limited labeled data.  
- Evaluate model performance with standard NLP metrics.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Transfer Learning**: Reusing knowledge from a large-scale Arabic language model (CAMelBERT).  
- **Fine-tuning**: Adjusting the model weights to adapt to stance detection.  
- **Evaluation**: Using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix to measure performance.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Hugging Face Transformers  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Results
The fine-tuned CAMelBERT model demonstrated strong performance in stance detection tasks, showing the power of transfer learning in low-resource NLP.

## 🔮 Applications
- Social media analysis (opinions, debates)  
- Political discourse analysis  
- Sentiment and stance mining for businesses
