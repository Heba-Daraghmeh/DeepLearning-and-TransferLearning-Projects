# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## 📖 Overview
This project applies **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, specifically **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models, to perform **time series forecasting**.  
The goal is to predict future values of a univariate feature (`power`) based on past time steps.

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn sequential dependencies in time-indexed data.  
- Build and evaluate an LSTM model for forecasting.  
- Apply deep learning for predictive analytics in energy/power consumption.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **RNNs** capture temporal dependencies in data.  
- **LSTM networks** solve vanishing gradient issues and handle long-term dependencies.  
- Evaluation metrics such as MAE and RMSE were used to measure forecasting performance.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras  
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Results
The LSTM model successfully captured temporal trends and produced forecasts that closely follow actual power usage patterns.  

## 🔮 Applications
- Energy demand forecasting  
- Stock market predictions  
- Weather forecasting
